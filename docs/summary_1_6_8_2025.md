## 📌 Vision

A personal CLI tool for:
- Projects + directories
- Todo lists (per project or recurring)
- Brag file (for accomplishments)
- Handy links dashboard (served locally)
- Focus tracking (backlog idea)
- Learning goals (backlog idea)

Built with:
- ✅ Cobra CLI
- ✅ SQLite (local-first storage)
- ✅ TDD-style development
- ✅ Justfile automation
- ✅ GPLv3 License

## 🧱 Folder Structure


## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

| ADR | Title |
|-----|-------|
| 0001 | Use SQLite for Local Data Storage |
| 0002 | Choose Cobra as the CLI Framework |
| 0003 | Serve Static HTML Using `net/http` |
| 0004 | Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) |
| 0005 | Define Project and Todo Data Models |
| 0006 | Store Brag File in SQLite |
| 0007 | Use Sqitch for Database Migrations *(optional)* |

## 🛠️ Core Features (Roadmap)

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Add projects with name/dir/status/category | ✅ Started |
| List projects | 🚧 In Progress |
| Manage todos per project | Backlog |
| Brag file (SQLite-based) | Backlog |
| Serve HTML dashboard | Backlog |
| Focus time tracking | Backlog |
| Learning goal tracking | Backlog |

## 📦 Recommended Tasks

1. Finish MVP: `wan project add` + `wan project list`
2. Write tests using TDD
3. Add database migrations (Sqitch or manual SQL)
4. Build HTML dashboard
5. Expand features based on need

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

You’re not just building a CLI — you’re building a **personalized dev companion** that reflects your habits, values, and personality.

And now you’ve got a clean summary to guide you every step of the way.
