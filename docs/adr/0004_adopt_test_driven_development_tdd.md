# 0004 - Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Date: 2025-04-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To ensure quality and maintainability, we want to develop new features by writing tests first.

## Decision

Adopt a TDD workflow where each feature begins with a failing test, followed by implementation, then refactoring.

## Consequences

- ✅ Higher confidence in correctness and refactor safety
- ✅ Encourages clean design and separation of concerns
- ❌ Slower initial development pace
- ✅ Easier onboarding and maintenance
