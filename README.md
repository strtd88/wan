# wan – Your Terminal Sidekick 🦸‍♂️

> wan helps developers organize their work, track progress, and stay focused — all from the comfort of the terminal.

wan is a personal CLI tool I'm building for my own use — with plans to share it when it's more stable.

It will eventually help me:
- Manage projects and directories
- Track todo lists per project or recurrence
- Keep a brag file of accomplishments
- Serve a local HTML dashboard of handy links
- Integrate with Obsidian notes
- Add focus tracking
- Capture learning goals

Right now, it's very early — but I'm building with TDD, SQLite, and love.

Is this going to be an open source command line app distributed through brew and similar outlets.
Goal is to be a tool for engineers, sales engineers, and others that have to use the terminal :)

This tool is your command line buddy.

Initial goal is to track your local projects, track your personal todos, bragfile and quick links http server
